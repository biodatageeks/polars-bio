            chunk_size: The size in MB of a chunk when reading from an object store. The default is 8 MB. For large scale operations, it is recommended to increase this value to 64.
            concurrent_fetches: [GCS] The number of concurrent fetches when reading from an object store. The default is 1. For large scale operations, it is recommended to increase this value to 8 or even more.

            enable_request_payer: [AWS S3] Whether to enable request payer for object storage. This is useful for reading files from AWS S3 buckets that require request payer.
            max_retries:  The maximum number of retries for reading the file from object storage.
            timeout: The timeout in seconds for reading the file from object storage.
